        <p>A workshop event is a hands-on learning experience where people come together to develop specific skills or
            knowledge on a particular topic. These events are usually led by an expert or facilitator and involve
            practical activities, discussions, and group interaction. Workshops can cover a wide range of subjects, from
            art and crafts to professional development and technology. They are a great way to gain practical skills and
            collaborate with others in a focused and interactive setting. Workshops often have limited attendees to
            ensure personalized attention and active participation.</p>

        <p>Stand-up comedy is like a funny one-person show. A comedian stands on a stage with a microphone and tells
            jokes, funny stories, or humorous observations to make people laugh. They often talk about everyday life,
            their experiences, or things that everyone can relate to. The goal is to entertain the audience and make
            them giggle, chuckle, or burst into laughter. It's all about humor and having a good time, both for the
            comedian and the people watching..</p>
