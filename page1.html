        <p>In the context of coding, an "event" is like a notification that something has happened in a computer
            program. It's a way for different parts of the program to communicate with each other.

            Imagine it's like a bell that rings when a specific action occurs, such as a button being clicked on a
            website. When that button is clicked, an "event" is triggered, and the program can respond to it by running
            a set of instructions or code.

            Events are important in coding because they allow programs to be interactive and respond to user actions,
            making software more dynamic and user-friendly. So, in simple words, an event is like a signal that tells a
            computer program to do something in response to an action..</p>

        <p>Sure, here's a simplified speech about being an engineer:

            "Being an engineer is like being a problem solver for the real world. Engineers use their creativity and
            technical skills to find solutions to everyday challenges. Whether it's designing a bridge that can
            withstand heavy traffic or creating a new smartphone app, engineers make our lives better.

            Imagine you love building things, like designing cool gadgets, or figuring out how things work. That's what
            engineers do! They use math and science to invent, build, and improve all sorts of stuff.

            So, if you enjoy solving puzzles and making things work better, being an engineer could be an exciting and
            rewarding path for you. It's all about using your brainpower to create a better future for everyone!".</p>

        <p>A startup event is like a big gathering for new and small businesses that are just getting started. It's a
            place where entrepreneurs and innovators come together to share their ideas, show off their products or
            services, and meet potential investors or customers.

            Think of it as a marketplace of fresh ideas and business opportunities. People at startup events might pitch
            their business plans, showcase their inventions, or network with others who can help their businesses grow.
            It's a chance to learn, collaborate, and get support for turning new ideas into successful businesses.</p>
